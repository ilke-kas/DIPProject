# Oculus Vigilis:Real-Time Attention Model

“Oculus Vigilis” aims  to help people to overcome their self-perceived attention problems such as ADHD or hyperactivity by giving a real-time feedback of the attention levels of one user using their camera records, especially during online meetings and learning processes.

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- At least [Python 3.11.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3118/)
